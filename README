Note: This is code that I last worked on in 1999. From my
recollection, it's a bunch of helper functions for DMs running AD&D
2nd edition campaigns. I do not know if it will be of interest to
anybody anymore! Heck, I do not even know if it still works. I also
don't know if my original instructions, included below, make any
sense. 

Good luck! Please enjoy.

The Magnificent Monster Database (MMDB) version 5.0 is distributed in a
modified format with this software by permission of Roger D. Mast
<masts@ptdprolog.net>.  My profound thanks goes out to him for allowing
me to use his database.

Thanks also go to A. Michelle Simmons <asimmon@IUPUI.EDU> for the Mage
and Priest spell databases, which I also modified for use in my
software.

The following links are fairly relevant to AD&D-Emacs:

Magnificent Monster Database homepage:
               http://www.istari.org/~olik/index.html
TSR, Inc.:     http://www.tsr.com/
AARG Homepage: http://www.aarg.net/


HOW TO INSTALL:

1. Put all of the .el files somewhere in your Emacs load path.

2. Put this in your .emacs file or your site init file:

   (autoload 'adnd-minor-mode "adnd" "AD&D Mode" t)

3. Find out where you're sticking the 'monster.raw' file, and do this
   in the same spot:

   (setq adnd-monster-db "/path/to/monster.raw")

Assuming easymenu is installed, all of the special keybindings and
things-that-are-ready should be outlined in the AD&D menu when you
activate `M-x adnd-minor-mode'.  If easymenu is not installed, you'll
need to get it.

Please send any feedback, bug reports, or suggestions to Erik Arneson
<erik@mind.net>.  Thanks for using my software!
